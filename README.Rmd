:toolbox: Tools for standardized rates in population health surveillance and epidemiology

### Features

-   `get_spec_rt()` calculates a specific/crude rate and constructs a confidence interval around the estimate.
-   `get_ds_rt()` calculates a directly standardized rate and constructs a confidence interval around the estimate using a user-specified standard population.
-   `get_smr()` performs indirect rate standardization to calculate the standardized mortality ratio (SMR).
-   `get_ci()` is a helper function used in the above functions but can also be called directly by the user.

This package is inspired by the R package [dsr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dsr/index.html), which has now been removed from the CRAN repository, and the SAS/STAT [STDRATE procedure](https://support.sas.com/documentation/onlinedoc/stat/151/stdrate.pdf). This package is also designed to play nicely with the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), as shown in the vignette.

### Installation

To install the package from GitHub, you will need the [remotes](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes) package.

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
```

Next, install the `bcEpiRate` package along with the vignette using:

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("bcgov/bcEpiRate", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

### Usage

See the vignette for this package using:

```{r eval=FALSE}
browseVignettes("bcEpiRate")
```

### Project Status

Currently, this package is composed of four functions. In the coming months, there are plans to add features for calculating measures of association (e.g. risk ratio, rate ratio) and estimating confidence intervals using additional probability distributions.
